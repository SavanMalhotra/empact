# empact

## Inspiration
Due to Covid-19, education was forced to take a virtual approach. Unlike in-person learning, having everything online can cause confusion and there might not be any physical way to organize homework and projects. Therefore, we developed Empact to help students organize their online learning with different tools.

## What it does
Empact is a website that is designed to help students organize their virtual learning experience and assist their daily tasks through OpenAI API's. For instance, Empact has a feature that allowed a student to input their notes and the AI will be able to generate and give a summary of what they wrote. In addition, students will be able to save the summary under their account and reference back to it later. 

## How we built it
The frontend web app was built using React.js and CSS to provide users with a clean and easy-to-use design. The backend used Flask and Python to fetch data from the OpenAI API.

## Challenges we ran into
Due to the time limitations and technical difficulties, lots of features that we wanted to add had to be scraped. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
-Completed something for the hackathon
-The code is able to read the OpenAI API
-Everyone learned new skills 

## What we learned 
-Manage time better
-Practice more react
-Learn more skills with React

## What's next for Empact?
-We are focusing on adding more features to Empact, (accounts, calenders, GPA calculators, job finders, and to-do list)
